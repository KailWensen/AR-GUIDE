# AR-GUIDE

## About the Project

ARGuide, An AR Navigation application which will provide real time navigation through Augmented reality. The purpose of this application is to provide easy and interactive navigation which in the traditional apps used to be confusing and uncertain. With AR Guide we aim to eradicate those issues.

Traditional navigation apps like Google Maps or Apple Maps even though can provide navigation solution for a much bigger scale but fail at providing navigation at small and private areas such as a university, government building or any office building. AR Guide fills that void by providing custom AR mapped navigation in personal or work environment.

The area of study can be mapped in the application and then the user can be provided with AR navigation in real time using their mobile phones and its camera system.

ARGuide – Navigation Personalised.
